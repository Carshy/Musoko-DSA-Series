# list in python is a data structure or rather a variable that is used to hold mutable data. what i mean is that it can hold different types of data for instance a string, a number, a float, or even a boolean

def my_list(lst):
  reversed = lst[::-1]
  return reversed
print(my_list(['banana', 3, 3.14, True, 'banana']))
