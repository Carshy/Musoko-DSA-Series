# list in python is a data structure or rather a variable that is used to hold mutable data. what i mean is that it can hold different types of data for instance a string, a number, a float, or even a boolean

# get a list of numbers from 0 to 10
def numList(nums):
  numbers = []
  for i in range(nums):
    return numbers.append(i)
print(numList([10]))
